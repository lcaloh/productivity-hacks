# OmniFocus Scripts

## OmniFocus Task to PomoDoneApp Timer (OF3-PomoDone.scpt)

Since PomoDoneApp is no longer syncing with OmniFocus 3, I quickly threw together this AppleScript to (1) grab the currently selected OmniFocus task into the clipboard, (2) create a new task in PomoDoneApp with the OmniFocus task, and (3) start the timer.

Works with web-downloaded version of PomoDoneApp (https://pomodoneapp.com/download-pomodone-app.html). MIGHT work with Mac App Store version, just change the name of the app from "PomoDoneApp" to "PomoDone App" in the script. 

OmniFocus portion of the script based on Curt Clifton's "Complete & Await Reply" AppleScript for OmniFocus.	Copyright Â© 2007-2008, 2012, 2014, Curtis Clifton All rights reserved.
